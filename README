docker-buildpackage -- easily build deb/apt packages within docker container
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
    * apt-based distro
    * working docker setup

Installation:
    * just clone the git repo (no system-wide installation yet)
    * check/adapt the target distro configs in cf/target/

What it does for you:
    * automatically debootstrap a build container base image
    * build deb's by launching a container, running the build inside it,
      pull out the deb's and cleanup again

Building a package:
    * chdir to your debianized source tree
    * call dck-buildpackage --target <target_name>
    * get big coffee ;-)
    * deb's are placed within $HOME/dckbp-apt-repo/

Autogenerated images:
    * apt download cache volumes: dckbp-aptacache-<target_name>
    * base images:                dckbp-baseimage-<target_name>
    * build containers:           dckbp-build-<target_name>-<uuid>

Cleanup:
    * temporary containers are removed automatically
    * apt caches remain until calling dck-buildpackage --cleanup

2DO:
    * automatically generate an installable apt-repo
    * add the local apt repo to the build container (for building packages
      depending on each other)
    * signing packages and repos
    * publishing built packages to remote repos
    * a decent manpage :o
    * installable package of this tool
    * cloning git repos instead of using local source tree
    * should dck-buildpackage --cleanup also remove base images ?
    * make deb target directory configurable
    * support subdirs and dots in target names (docker names/tags are derived
      from that, and it doesn't like some chars in there ...)
    * add finer per-target configuration of base image, volume, container names
    * add cleanup for only one specific target
    * per package cache images, so deps need to be deployed only once
    * separate clean for only apt-cache, base images, containers, ...
    * command line option for separate configs
    * honor .gitignore
